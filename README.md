# **Sentiment Analysis**
A Sentiment Analysis project that analyzes the sentiment behind text data and classifies it as either positive or negative. Built using Python and powered by the TextBlob library, this project aims to demonstrate the ability to extract insights from textual data through sentiment prediction.

# **📌 Project Overview**
Sentiment analysis is a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the goal is to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. This project leverages the power of machine learning and NLP libraries to process, analyze, and predict sentiment from text data.

## **Key Features:**
Text Analysis: Processes text data and classifies it as positive or negative.
Prediction: Utilizes the TextBlob library for sentiment classification.
Web Interface: An easy-to-use web application where users can input text and get sentiment predictions in real-time.


## **🛠️ Technologies Used**
Python: The main programming language used for the project.
Flask: A micro web framework used to create the web application.
TextBlob: A library used for natural language processing to determine the sentiment of text.
HTML/CSS: For creating the web interface.
JavaScript: To enhance user interaction.
