# **üìå Project Overview**
Sentiment analysis is a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the goal is to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. This project leverages the power of machine learning and NLP libraries to process, analyze, and predict sentiment from text data.







## **Key Features:**
Text Analysis: Processes text data and classifies it as positive or negative.
Prediction: Utilizes the TextBlob library for sentiment classification.
Web Interface: An easy-to-use web application where users can input text and get sentiment predictions in real-time.







## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**
Python: The main programming language used for the project.
Flask: A micro web framework used to create the web application.
TextBlob: A library used for natural language processing to determine the sentiment of text.
HTML/CSS: For creating the web interface.
JavaScript: To enhance user interaction.
